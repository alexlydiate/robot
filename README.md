the Robot of Paradise
=====

A c++ roving robot project for Linux and Arduino
-----

This is the software for my ongoing mobile robot project.

My intent is to make a machine that can locate a person in a room, travel to them avoiding any obstacles and then identify them.

Don't ask me why.

I'm going to put up a project page somewhere on the Web in due course, but in the meantime I'm noting the progress on [Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+AlexLydiate/posts).
